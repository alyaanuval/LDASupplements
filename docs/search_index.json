This process involves gathering data, understanding models of uncertainty,making general inferences, and communicating results business intelligence May focus on processes of collecting data, often through databases and data warehouses business analytics Utilizes tools and methods for statistical analyses of data data science Can encompass broader applications in many scientific domains short-term Contracts where the insurance coverage is typically provided for six months or a year property insurance In the US, policies such as renters and homeowners casualty insurance In the US, a policy such as auto that covers medical damages to people nonlife or general insurance In the rest of the world, property and casualty insurance are both known as nonlife or general insurance, to distinguish them from life insurance Underwriting The process of classifying risks into homogenous categoriesand assigning policyholders to these categories, lies at the core of ratemaking. Policyholders within a class have similar risk profiles and so are charged thesame insurance price ratemaking Where analysts seek to determine the right price for the right risk experience rating or merit rating Modifying premiums with claims history claims adjustment The process of determining coverage, legal liability, and settling claims claims leakage Dollars lost through claims management inefficiencies loss reserving Setting aside money for unpaid claims claim At a fundamental level, insurance companies accept premiums in exchange for promises to indemnify a policyholder upon the uncertain occurrence of an insured event. This indemnification is known as aÂ claim severity A positive amount is a key financial expenditure for an insurer.
